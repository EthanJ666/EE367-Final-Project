This directory includes three files, each for one experiment settings as described in the project report.
To run the code successfully, you need to also download HFlickr dataset (https://github.com/bcmi/Image-Harmonization-Dataset-iHarmony4)
and IntrinsicCompositing source code (https://yaksoy.github.io/intrinsicCompositing/).

Before using the source code provided here, you need to preprocess the HFlickr dataset using IntrinsicCompositing (following instrunctions in their README file)
and put the preprocessed data in folder named 'semi_harmonized_HFlickr' (or you can always change the path to the dataset to any name you like)
